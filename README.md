# ISL_Gesture_Recognition
A real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) gesture recognition system developed as part of my NTCC (Non-Teaching Credit Course) project.

# Project Overview
This project is focused on recognizing static hand gestures of ISL alphabets using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It performs real-time gesture recognition using a webcam and was built individually as part of my college coursework.

# Key Features
ðŸ”¤ Real-time ISL alphabet gesture recognition

ðŸ“· Webcam-based live prediction

ðŸ§  Custom-trained CNN model

ðŸ“š Academic project under NTCC submission

# Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy

Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

# Workflow
Data Collection

Static gesture images of ISL alphabets were collected and labeled.

Model Training

A CNN was trained on the dataset to recognize hand gestures.

Real-Time Recognition

OpenCV was used to access webcam input and classify gestures in real time.

# Getting Started
Install Dependencies
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy

Run the Real-Time Recognition
python test.py
